\large{\emph{Social Engineering attack is a major security threat that needs to be
dealt. The only way to counter attack is to raise awareness among the users
of what all is possible in Social engineering attack and how it can be done.
We want to build a tool that will use Social Networking sites like facebook as
a platform to harnest the users data available and use that to impersonate
them via profile hijacking. Then we intend to use man in the middle attack
and make them reveal some information which is not available as a public
data. To test this we will use a modified version of the turing test.\\[1cm]}}
