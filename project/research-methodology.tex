\section{Passive Information Gathering Module}

\subsection{HTTP}
To implement Web Scraping module for Information Gathering we need to understand the HTTP protocol. HTTP (The Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the 
foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

\subsubsection{Request methods}
HTTP defines nine methods (sometimes referred to as "verbs") indicating the desired action to be performed on the identified 
resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the 
implementation of the server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable residing on the server.\\[0.5cm]
Following are the main request methods we will be dealing with :-
\begin{description}
\item[POST : ] Submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both.
\item[GET : ] Requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other 
effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.) The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, 
"Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations."

\subsection{urllib2}
Since we will be using Python 2.x for our project, we will be using the standard library for doing the HTTP requests to be made.
The urllib2 module defines functions and classes which help in opening URLs (mostly HTTP) in a complex world — basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies and more.\cite{py_urllib2}

urllib2.urlopen(url[, data][, timeout])\\[0.5cm]

\emph{ - Open the URL url, which can be either a string or a Request object.}

\subsection{Regular Expressions}
A Regular Expression is the term used to describe a codified method of searching invented, or defined, by the American mathematician Stephen Kleene.\cite{whatisregex}

\subsection{XMPPPY}
xmpppy is a Python library that is targeted to provide easy scripting with Jabber. Similar projects are Twisted Words and jabber.py.\\[0.5cm]
This library was not designed from scratch. It inherits some code from jabberpy and have very similar API in many places. Though it is separate project since it have almost completely different architecture and primarily aims to work with jabberd2 - the new Open Source Jabber Server.\\
We tried to use this library but we had issues\cite{xmpppy_issue1}\cite{xmpppy_issue2}. Even though we were finally able to resolve the issue\cite{xmpppy_issue3}\\[0.5cm]
We didn't use this library due to insufficient documentation. The project was stuck for a while and we could not move it forward.

\subsection{SleekXMPP}

To resolve the issue of XMPP library we Found SleekXMPP.\\[0.5cm]
SleekXMPP is an MIT licensed XMPP library for Python 2.6/3.1+\\[0.5cm]
SleekXMPP’s design goals and philosphy are:
\begin{description}
\item[ Low number of dependencies :] Installing and using SleekXMPP should be as simple as possible, without having to deal with long dependency chains.\\As part of reducing the number of dependencies, some third party modules are included with SleekXMPP in the thirdparty directory. Imports from this module first try to import an existing installed version before loading the packaged version, when possible.
\item[Every XEP as a plugin :] Following Python’s “batteries included” approach, the goal is to provide support for all currently active XEPs (final and draft). Since adding XEP support is done through easy to create plugins, the hope is to also provide a solid base for implementing and creating experimental XEPs.
\item[Rewarding to work with :] As much as possible, SleekXMPP should allow things to “just work” using sensible defaults and appropriate abstractions. XML can be ugly to work with, but it doesn’t have to be that way.
