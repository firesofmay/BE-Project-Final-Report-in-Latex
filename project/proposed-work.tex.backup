\subsection{Social Networks}
A social networking service is an online service, platform, or site that focuses on building and reflecting of social networks or social relations among people, who, for example, share interests and/or activities and people with similar or somewhat similar interests, backgrounds and/or activities make their own communities.
A social network service consists of a representation of each user (often a
profile), his/her social links, and a variety of additional services.
