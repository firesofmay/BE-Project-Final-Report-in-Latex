\subsection{Social Engineering}
Social Engineering is the act of manipulating a person to take an action that
may or may not be in the targets best interest. This may include obtaining
information, gaining access, or getting the target to take certain action\cite{book_se}

\subsection{Current Scneario}
Businesses spend a significant portion of their annual information technology
budgets on high-tech computer security. But the firewalls, vaults, bunkers,
locks and biometrics those dollars buy can be pierced by attackers targeting
untrained, uninformed or unmonitored users. Humans are the weakest link in
any security system, according to KL-based organizers of the Hackers Halted
Asia Pacific 2009 conference.\cite{link_humanweak}\\[0.5cm]
The chief minister of Malacca, Datuk Seri Haji Mohd Ali Bin Mohd Rus-
tam, said there is no perfect system in the world. ”Even if you have the best
security devices and software–your organization still relies on humans–who
are the weakest link in any security system. Public education and awareness
is essential.”\\[0.5cm]

Malicious Insider and Careless/Untrained Insider is a bigger threat than an

Also, in the age of Social Networking Sites like Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin,
Google+ information of companies internal hierarchy structure, employees,

personal information is readily available online for the information gathering
phase to breach companies security perimeter by various social engineering
ways like phishing links, Trojans, Backdoors, Password guessing, breaking
security questions etc.\\[0.5cm]
Is it possible to break into the circle of friends network on social networking
sites and make them reveal certain information about them which can be
used further to infiltrate the security perimeter of a company?\\[0.5cm]
Our project is designed to answer this Question and provide a Proof of Con-
cept that Yes, it can be done and without even raising any suspicion on the
target for a long time.

\section{Basic Concept}
In this project we will use two main concepts:

%BLAH BLAH
\subsection{Profile Hijacking}
%BLAH BLAH

In Profile Hijacking, we will impersonate the target(s) profile on Social Net-
working Sites like Facebook and use their identity to infiltrate the network
of other targets friend to fit in the group. Profile Hijacking is important, to
use them to reveal certain information without their knowledge.\cite{paper_allyourcontacts}


\subsection{Using Humans as Botnets}
%BLAH BLAH

We studied many AI based Chat Bots that are available on the web and
we found that Using Chat Bots to chat with humans for Social Engineering Attack is not feasible as Humans detect that the other person is not a
human but a program and hence the attack fails even before it is launched.\cite{paper_towardsautomating}\\[0.5cm]
Since developing a fully convincing AI based Chat Bot is not possible consid-
ering the Scope, we will use another human to do the talking with our target
while we sit in between, watch and modify the conversation towards the
conversation which would reveal certain information which we are interested
in.\cite{paper_honeybot}


\section{Application}
%BLAH BLAH
Some of the best tools for fighting social engineering attacks are security
awareness training and social engineering testing. The effectiveness of these
controls will vary based on the quality of their implementation, including
follow-up and retraining.\\[0.5cm]
Social engineering testing, by its very nature, can be difficult to conduct
without third-party assistance. One option is to engage an information secu-
rity organization to conduct testing. The testing can uncover areas in which
an organization is most vulnerable so that risk can be assessed and mitiga-
tion strategies can be formulated and implemented.\\[0.5cm]
Rolling social engineering testing into a larger security penetration engage-
ment can reduce the cost of the social engineering component, says Jim
Patterson, director of consulting for Rapid7.\cite{link_humanweak}\\[0.5cm]
Main Application of this Project is to develop a tool that will aid in Do-
ing Social Engineering Testing on Companies Employees, also it will provide
as a live demonstration to employees under training on how social engineer-
ing can be done and how by being cautious one can prevent serious damage
not only to the company but also to their private life.\\[0.5cm]
