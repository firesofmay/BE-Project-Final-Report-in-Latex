\chapter{Conclusion and Future Scope}


\section{Future Scope}

The project certainly has a lot of scope. Let's take a look at some of them

\begin{itemize}
\item{We could extend the capabilities of extracting information to gather personal information as well like About Me page of the user.}
\item{Parallizes the HTTP request to make it faster}
\item{Deploy the passive information extractor on Amazon EC2 Servers.}
\item{Hook up AI bots like megahal\cite{wiki_megahal} in Facebook Chat Attack and train our scripts to learn when/what to modify}
\item{Feature to clone profiles}
\item{Scale the architecture where Facebook Chat Attack would work on more then just two people at the same time}
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The project was sucessfully implemented and a Proof of Concept was established that Social Engineering can be done on Social Networks.\\
We were able to extract out public information from Facebook user's profile on a mass scale. Also we demonstrated that Trust between two users can be used to extract out information which is not available publicaly.
